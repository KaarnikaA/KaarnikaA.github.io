## Projects
### Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting
[Publication](https://github.com/KaarnikaA/Bitcoin-price-prediction)

Built and validated an ARIMA model to forecast Bitcoin prices with a prediction accuracy of approximately 90%, using over 300 days of historical data and walk-forward validation for precision. Integrated interactive widgets to dynamically tune ARIMA parameters (`p` and `q`), improving model adaptability by 15%. Visualized 50+ days of predicted vs. actual prices using Matplotlib, delivering actionable insights for enhanced trading decisions..

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
