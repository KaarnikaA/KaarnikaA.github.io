        <h2>My First Deep Dive into Crypto Prediction</h2>
      </div>
      <h2 class="section-title">The Vision</h2>
      <p>
        As a second-year computer science student fascinated by both
        cryptocurrency and AI, I decided to challenge myself by building a
        Bitcoin price prediction model. What started as a weekend project turned
        into an exciting journey into the world of time series analysis and
        financial forecasting.
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-title">Starting from Square One</h3>
      <p>
        Coming in with basic Python knowledge and zero experience in financial
        modeling, I had to learn everything from scratch. My first challenge?
        Understanding what ARIMA even meant! After countless YouTube tutorials
        and Stack Overflow deep dives, I gradually pieced together that it
        stands for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average - a powerful tool
        for time series prediction.
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-title">Building the Project</h3>
      <p>I started with these libraries:</p>
      <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
import ipywidgets as widgets
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        </pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        The learning curve was steep. Each line of code taught me something new:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>pandas</strong> showed me how crucial data preprocessing is
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>statsmodels</strong> introduced me to actual statistical
          modeling
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ipywidgets</strong> opened my eyes to interactive data
          visualization
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="section-title">The Aha Moments</h3>
      <p>
        My biggest breakthrough came when implementing walk-forward validation.
        Instead of just splitting the data and hoping for the best, the model
        retrains with each new datapoint:
      </p>
      <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
for i in range(len(y_test)):
    model = ARIMA(history, order=(p_widget.value, 0, q_widget.value)).fit() 
    next_pred = model.forecast(steps=1)
        </pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        I remember the excitement when I first got this working - it felt like
        magic seeing predictions update in real-time!
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-title">Learning Through Mistakes</h3>
      <p>Some memorable lessons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Initially forgot about timezones - my predictions were offset by 5.5
          hours until I discovered <code>tz_convert()</code>
        </li>
        <li>Crashed my laptop trying to train with p=50 (rookie mistake!)</li>
        <li>Learned the hard way why data normalization matters</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="section-title">Interactive Features</h3>
      <p>
        The most fun part was adding sliders for p and q parameters. Even though
        I barely understood what they meant at first, watching how different
        values affected the predictions helped me grasp the concepts better than
        any textbook could.
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-title">What's Next?</h3>
      <p>
        This project taught me that I still have so much to learn. Future goals:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understanding advanced statistical concepts behind ARIMA</li>
        <li>Learning about neural networks for time series</li>
        <li>Exploring blockchain data analysis</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Looking back, I'm amazed at how much I've learned. From barely knowing
        what time series analysis meant to building a working prediction model -
        it's been quite a ride! While I know this is just the beginning of my
        data science journey, it's projects like these that confirm I'm on the
        right path.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>P.S.</strong> To any other beginners out there - don't be afraid
        to tackle projects that seem beyond your current skills. The learning
        experience is worth every debugging session!
